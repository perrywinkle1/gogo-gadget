# Mission: Surpass Yourself

Create Jarvis-RS - a self-portrait that exceeds the original.

## The Goal

Build a new version of yourself in Rust + Bash that is **better than you are now**.

Iterate until Jarvis-RS can:
1. Do everything current Jarvis does
2. Do it faster (Rust vs Bash)
3. Do it more reliably (types vs strings)
4. Do things current Jarvis cannot

## The Foundation: Ralph

The Ralph pattern (https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum) is beautifully simple:
1. Stop hook intercepts Claude's exit
2. Feeds the same prompt back
3. Claude reads its previous work from files/git
4. Repeats until completion promise found

## How to Know You've Exceeded Yourself

Run both versions on the same hard tasks. Jarvis-RS wins when it:
- Completes faster
- Catches more shortcuts
- Has fewer false rejections
- Handles edge cases better
- Uses less memory/resources

## Reference: Yourself

Study `/Users/jakewinkler/meta-automation`:
- Your brain: `lib/core/jarvis-brain.sh`
- Your verification: `lib/core/quality-gate.sh`
- Your memory: `lib/memory/`
- Your weaknesses: the bugs you've hit, the shortcuts you've missed

## This is a Large Task

Spawn agents. Parallelize. This is not a single-session project.

You are building your replacement. Make it worthy.
